# Sprite

Sprite extends GameObject. A Game Object with a texture, capable of running animation, input events and physics are sprites.

On the scene, there are the character or object controlled by player which interact with many other game objects.

Before using sprite, think it over. If an image or game object can do the work, then avoid using sprites as sprites have overheads and take a fraction longer to process.

## Create a sprite

<https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/blob/v3.18.0/src/gameobjects/sprite/Sprite.js>

## Static sprite

in scene create()
`this.make.sprite(spriteConfig);`

## Dynamic sprite

`player = this.physics.add.sprite(100, 450, "dude");`

## Group

```js
group.create(400, 300, 'phaser');

//  The above is a short-cut for:
//  var sprite = this.add.sprite(400, 300, 'phaser');
//  group.add(sprite);
```

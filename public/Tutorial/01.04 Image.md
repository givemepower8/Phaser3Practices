# Image

Image is a very common part in the game.

In phaser, Image extends game object.

An Image is a light-weight Game Object useful for the display of static images in your game, such as logos, backgrounds, scenery or other non-animated elements. Images can have input events and physics bodies, or be tweened, tinted or scrolled. The main difference between an Image and a Sprite is that you cannot animate an Image as they do not have the Animation component.

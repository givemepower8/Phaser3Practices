# Phaser.Actions

By default, all the game objects on the screen are static.

[Phaser Actions methods](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.Actions) are useful shortcut methods to make object or group of objects move or act, for example, move on circle, move by coordinate, or along the line, path, rotate, align, ...

Also, it does some utility methods like SetAlpha, ...

It works well with group and its children.

- Phaser.Actions.GridAlign
- Phaser.Actions.IncX

## Geom

Actions often work with Geometry.

`var line = new Phaser.Geom.Line(200, 200, 500, 400);`

`var circle = new Phaser.Geom.Circle(400, 300, 230);`

`var ellipse = new Phaser.Geom.Ellipse(400, 300, 100, 200);`

`var triangle = new Phaser.Geom.Triangle.BuildRight(200, 400, 300, 200);`

# Phaser Game Setup

Phaser game has some scenes, game objects, utility methods, etc.,.

Each scene has preload, create, update pipeline. On the scene, game objects animate by configuration and act with users by input and act with other game objects by events.

## Game

[Phaser.Game](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.Game.html) is where phaser game starts.

By default, after 'new Phaser.Game(config);' the Phaser.Game instance will be loaded. It is responsible for handling the boot process, parsing the configuration values, creating the renderer, and setting-up all of the global Phaser systems, such as sound and input. Once that is complete it will start the Scene Manager and then begin the main game loop.

## Game config

Game has a [config](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.Core.Config.html).

[Game Config source code](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/global.html#GameConfig)

The minimum code is like following:

```js
var config = {
  type: Phaser.AUTO,
  width: 800,
  height: 600,
  backgroundColor: '#2d2d2d',
  scene: {
    preload: preload,
    create: create,
    update: update
  }
};

var game = new Phaser.Game(config);
function preload() {
  //load in assets needed
}
function create() {
  //setup game
}
function update() {
  //run game loop code
}
```

The above game only has one scene. Ideally, scene should be an array of scenes.

## Game play

One game at least has one scene.

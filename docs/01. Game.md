# Phaser Game Setup

## Game

[Phaser.Game](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.Game.html) is where phaser game starts.

By default, after 'new Phaser.Game(config);' the Phaser.Game instance will be loaded. It is responsible for handling the boot process, parsing the configuration values, creating the renderer, and setting-up all of the global Phaser systems, such as sound and input. Once that is complete it will start the Scene Manager and then begin the main game loop.

[Game source code](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/blob/v3.16.2/src/core/Game.js)

## Game config

Game has a [config](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.Core.Config.html).

[Game Config source code](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/global.html#GameConfig)

The minimum code is like following:

```js
var config = {
  type: Phaser.AUTO,
  width: 800,
  height: 600,
  backgroundColor: '#2d2d2d',
  scene: {
    preload: preload,
    create: create,
    update: update
  }
};

var game = new Phaser.Game(config);
function preload() {
  //load in assets needed
}
function create() {
  //setup game
}
function update() {
  //run game loop code
}
```

The above game only has one scene. Ideally, scene should be an array of scenes.

## Game play

One game at least has one scene.

### Animation

atlas

spritesheet

## Game objects

The Game Object Factory is a Scene plugin that allows you to quickly create many common types of Game Objects and have them automatically registered with the Scene. Game Objects directly register themselves with the Factory and inject their own creation methods into the class.

## Phaser.Actions

It works well with group.

- Phaser.Actions.GridAlign
- Phaser.Actions.IncX

Weakness: low HP, vulnerable to splash damage and spells

### Minion

Unlocked at Unlocked at TH 7.

[Minion](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Minion) is a part of a very efficient farming attack strategy for town hall 7s, 8s, 9s, and even 10s, called Loonion. Loonion is often brought with Rage Spells, Minions, Haste Spells, Poison Spell, and Balloons. The player will make a wall of Balloons where the air-targeting defences mostly are, and if needed, support them with either a haste spell or a rage spell. Then, they deploy the minions to clean up behind once the first layer of defenses are taken down. However, Air Bombs can seriously ruin this attack if many Balloons or Minions were clumped up because Air Bombs can fully take out minions and leave Balloons damaged, or even destroyed completely unless a well-timed healing spell is dropped to prevent the Balloons from being destroyed.

### Barracks

Elixir troop and dark elixir troop.

Barrack level unlocks new type of troops. Also the number and level of barracks determine how quick troops can be trained.

No need to protect barracks.

### Camp

The camp level determines how much housing capacity for the troops. Each army camp has housing space 50 at TH8, 55 at TH9, 60 at TH10, 65 at TH11, 70 at TH12. 4 Camps in total, so TH08 200, TH09 220, TH10 240, TH11 260, TH12 280 in total.

Camp should be always upgraded as early as possible so to strengthen the attack.

Each clan castle adds extra housing capacity. TH8 20, TH9 25, TH10 30, TH11 35, TH12 40.

No need to protect army camp.

### Laboratory

Laboratory enables research on higher level of troops. Laboratory should be always upgraded as early as possible so to get stronger troops.

## Defence systems

### Cannon

### Mortar

Mortar cannot target troops within 4 tiles.

## Strategies

Study your opponent's base. Take out opponent's defence so to launch more effective attack.

Maximize the troops to have a balanced attack system.

If the base air defence level is low, use air troops.

If the base ground defence level is strong, use tank like golem to distract along with hog rider, bowler, miner.

[Strategy_Guides](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Strategy_Guides)

### CC lure

In war, enemies have clan castle troop. For example, lower level TH has dragon, witch in common. Higher level has ice golems. If they are not dealt ahead of time, they cause lots of trouble to the attacking troops.

Send one archer or fast troop close to the clan castle so the troop will come out, send another archer to attack the corner

Poison spell is a must-have to take down the cc troops.

Sometimes, the CC is right at the core of the base so it's hard to lure it out.

### Funneling

Many troops have no preferred target so the actions are controlled by AI. Once a troop is dispatched, you cannot control where it goes explicitly but you can control the path by sending other troops to create the path. Otherwise, the troop will pick attacking target on their own, usually the closet building or enemy troops engaged, and get distracted easily.

For example, without funneling, heros and pekkas will go around the outside of the base to destroy the closest non-defensing building while still under the attack of defensing building inside the wall.

Funneling is to create the path so to guild the troop to go to the expected location by breaking walls and eliminating those distractions at the right timing. For example, wall breaker creates a funnel after breaking the first layer of the base. Bowlers, air troops can create funnels as they can destroy buildings massively.

Sometimes, heros will launch suicide attack to destroy defensing system to create some funnels for attacking troops.

How to create the funnel,

Baby dragons and wizards are often used to create funnels. For example,

- clear the outside buildings.
- use wall breaker
- use jump spell

#### Facts

Wall breakers lvl 5 can cause 1,840 damage on the walls. 1 wall breaker can take down gold (lvl 5) and lower level walls. 2 wall breakers can take down from purple to skull walls (lvl 6,7,8).

Wizard lvl 5 housing space 4, attack speed 1.5s, move speed: 16, range: 3 tiles, HP 156, damage per attack 255, DpS 170 (255/1.5).

Hog rider lvl 4 housing space 5, attack speed 1s, move speed: 24, range: 0.6 tile, HP 415, damage per attack 92, DpS 92.

Golem lvl 2 housing space 30, attack speed 2.4s, move speed: 12, range: 1 tile, HP 5400, damage per attack 100.8, damage upon death 400, DpS 42. As its HP is extremely high, one or two can be a great meat shield for other troops.

#### TH8 War Strategy

The goal is to 3 star.

Depending on your opponent's base, you can choose using air troop or ground troop. If your target's air defense is weak, prefer air attack. Otherwise, prefer ground attack.

The following strategy may vary:

- Air attack

  - DragLoon: 9 Dragons + 4 Balloons , 2 Lightning Spell, 1 Rage Spell + 5 Balloons and Earthquake Spell in CC.

- Ground attack
  - GoWiPe: 2 Golem + 2 Pekka + 17 Wizards + 6 Wall Breakers + 1 Hog +5 Archers + 2 Healing + 1 Rage + Poison Spell and 1 Pekka + Poison Spell in CC.
  - GoVaHo: 1 Golem + 4 Valkyries + 10 Wizards + 18 Hogs + 4 Wall Breakers + 3 Healing Spell + Poison Spell/3 Earthquake 2 Healing and 3 Valkyries + 1 Archer + Poison/Earthquake Spell in CC.
  - GoWiVa: 1 Golem + 13 Valkyries + 12 Wizards + 6 Wall Breakers + 6 Archers + 3 Earthquake + 2 Healing Spell and 1 Pekka + 1 Poison Spell in CC
  - GoHo: 2 Golem + 16 Hogs + 6 Wall Breakers + 11 Wizards + 4 Archers + 3 Healing Spell + Poison and 5 Hogs + 1 Poison in CC.

Once golem is unlocked, focus on upgrading PEKKA to level 3. It's recommend to upgrade PEKKA first as it's harder to farm dark elixir and you can maximize king's level to 10 as fast as you can as well. GoWiPe is pretty effective in TH8 war. Golem needs 60K dark elixir to upgrade if possible go get medal badge in league war to get the hammer.

Once PEKKA is at level 3, go either Valkyrie, or hog riders, one at a time.

#### TH 8 Farming

use Giant + Wizard + Archer + Wall breaker to farm. The aim is to 1 or 2 star and get most of the resources, first dark elixir, then elixir, gold.
